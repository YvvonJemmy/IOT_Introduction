# INTERNET OF THINGS INTRODUCTION
## INTRODUCTION TO ARDUINO
Arduino is a free and open-source platform with simple hardware and software. Arduino boards can read inputs such as a light on a sensor and convert them into outputs such as activating a motor or turning on an LED.
### SETTING UP THE ARDUINO
Before you can use the hardware, you must first master the software. We write software that controls hardware.
### DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING THE ARDUINO IDE
The hardware makes use of the Arduino IDE software. Follow these steps to download it:
- Visit http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software to get the latest version of the software in accordance to your operating system.
- Save the exe file.
- Open the exe file
- Agree to the terms and conditions
- Then decide which items you want to install
- Then install the software
### SETTING UP THE ARDUINO
In this section, we configure the software so that it is ready for use with the hardware. Follow the following steps:
- Select Tools from the drop-down menu, then select Boards.
- Select your arduino board from the boards menu.
### TESTING THE ARDUINO
Examine the examples listed on the IDE's menu.
## PROGRAMING THREE LED BLINKING LIGHTS
### TOOLS REQUIRED
- ARDUINO
- BREADBOARD
- THREE JUMPER WIRES
- TWO RESISTORS
- TWO LEDS
- USB CABLE
- ARDUINO IDE

### PROCEDURE
- Using the USB cable, connect the arduino to your computer.
- Check the port connection on the TOOLS on the menu bar.
- Then, using a jumper wire, connect the arduino to the breadboard. Connect the positive terminal to the ground wire.
- Place the LEDs and resistors in a straight line.
- Select the ports to be used.
- Connect the ports and the LEDs using jumper wires.
## DHT SENSOR PROGRAMING
A DHT sensor is used to measure a location's humidity and temperature.
### TOOLS REQUIRED
- ARDUINO BOARD
- DHT SENSOR
- THREE JUMPER WIRES 
- USB CABLE
- ARDUINO IDE

### PROCEDURE
- Connect the Arduino to your computer.
- Connect the DHT sensor with the three jumper wires.
- The positive jumper wire connects it to the Arduino board's 5 volts port.
- The negative jumper wire connects it to the Arduino board's ground port.
## PROGRAMING THE ESP8266
The ESP8266 is a highly integrated, low-cost Wi-Fi MCU.
### TOOLS REQUIRED
- ESP8266 NODEMCU BOARD
- USB CABLE
- ARDUINO IDE
### PROCEDURE
- Connect the NodeMCU to your computer. Connect your NodeMCU to the computer using the USB cable.
- Introduce the software. Use the link below and follow the steps that follow.
- http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
- Select Preferences from the File menu and paste the copied code into the Additional Board Manager URLs section. Then click OK.
- Search for ESP8266 in the Tools menu's Boards then the boards manager.  
- Then install the ESP8266.
- Test it by using the menuâ€™s example: BLINK
- The LED will blink.
